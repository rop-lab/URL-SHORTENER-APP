-The JavaScript file handles the dynamic functionality of the URL shortener:

- Event Listeners: Sets up event listeners for form submission and like button clicks.

-URL Shortening: Fetches data from db.json and simulates API responses. Checks if the URL already exists, and if not, generates a shortened URL.

-Like Functionality: Updates the like count when the user clicks the like button and simulates updating the database.

-Database Interaction: Simulates updating the database (db.json) with the latest data, both when shortening a URL and when liking a URL.

-Display Shortened URL: Updates the UI to display the shortened URL in an alert container.

## Notes
This project uses a simulated database in the form of a JSON file (db.json). In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with a server and a proper database.

The project uses the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to the simulated database.
